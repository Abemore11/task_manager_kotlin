# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal with this project was to strengthen my understanding of Kotlin’s core object-oriented features and explore the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural design. This project allowed me to focus on writing clean, maintainable, and modular software that clearly separates responsibilities between components.

This is a console-based Task Manager application built entirely in Kotlin. It demonstrates the use of variables (both mutable and immutable), expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes. It also uses the when keyword to handle user input. The program allows users to create, edit, delete, and list tasks through a simple text-based interface.

The purpose of writing this software was to deepen my understanding of Kotlin’s syntax and structure while applying software engineering principles such as separation of concerns and modular design.

# Development Environment

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **JDK:** Eclipse Temurin 21.0.8+9-LTS (OpenJDK 21 LTS)
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
- **No external libraries** were used — this project relies entirely on Kotlin’s standard library and core language features.

# Future Work

- Implement persistent storage so tasks are saved between sessions.
- Introduce filtering or sorting options (e.g., by importance or status).
- Expand the project into a GUI or web-based interface using Kotlin frameworks.
